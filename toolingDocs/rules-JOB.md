# Job Contract Documentation Rules (JOB)

**See also:** [cross-layer-discipline.md](cross-layer-discipline.md) — shared discipline for all `_ar/**` canonical docs.

## Purpose

JOB documents describe background execution contracts.

They define:

- why the job exists
- what triggers it
- what input scope it processes
- what side effects it causes
- how it handles failure and idempotency

JOB documents do not describe infrastructure deployment.
